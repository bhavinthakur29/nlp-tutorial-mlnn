# Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM

## Overview
This project explores **Sentiment Analysis** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, a deep learning approach for classifying text sentiment as **positive, negative, or neutral**. The tutorial covers **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** such as tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and word embeddings.

## Requirements
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- NLTK for text preprocessing

## Usage
Run the Python script:
```sh
python sentiment_analysis.py
```
